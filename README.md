This is a minimal repo based on `create-react-app` to demonstrate an issue with Storybook 6.x-rc

To see the problem, start storybook with `yarn storybook` and select the story for the `TextField` component. We utilize `useArgs` hook to update the `value` prop for the controlled component; while this works fine in the "Canvas" mode, when used in the "Docs" mode, the component loses focus after every key press (thus every time the args are updated).
